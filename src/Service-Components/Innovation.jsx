                            Our sorting machines use advanced optical sensors and AI algorithms to analyze and categorize food products based on size, color, shape, and even subtle defects. This ensures that the final product meets strict industry standards for quality, purity, and safety. Whether it's sorting grains, pulses, or nuts, Neotek ensures maximum yield while minimizing wastage.

                        <p>
                            The sorting process begins by scanning and detecting impurities or foreign materials in raw food products. The products are then separated based on predefined quality parameters, ensuring that only the top-grade items are processed further. Our commitment to food safety and efficiency makes Neotek a trusted partner for businesses in the food industry, striving to deliver superior products to consumers.
